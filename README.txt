Running the J-App Application:

Install libraries:
- Copy python code files in a new Folder
- Set up a virtual environment and install the requirements file
- Run JApp_ED_v1.py or JApp_ED_v1_SERR_control.py




Remember to Change global variables in .py files!
	- Test frequency
	- Compliance calibration

If only J should be evaluated set dummy values for compliance calibration and modified compliance calibration Parameters.

For evaluation of SERR controlled data, J values were compared with the measured G value of the current cycle calculated directly during the fatigue experiment using the WaveMatrix calculations module.
